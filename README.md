## To run/build app:

- clone repo to your machine
- cd in to the repo directory on your machine
- create a file in the repo called .env
- in .env write `VITE_API_KEY=<put your api key here>` and save
- if you don't have node/npm, get online and download node
- in the terminal you used to cd in to the repo, run `npm i` and wait for packages to install
- to run locally, run `npm run dev`
- to build the app for production run `npm run build`
- after building, you will have a /dist folder in the root of the repo that has your index.html entry point
